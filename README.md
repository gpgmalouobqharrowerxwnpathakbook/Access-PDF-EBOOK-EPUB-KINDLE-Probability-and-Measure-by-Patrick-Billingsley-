PROBABILITY AND MEASURE

Third Edition

Now in its new third edition, Probability and Measure offers advanced students, scientists, and engineers an integrated introduction to measure theory and probability. Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and cond

Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley Book Review

Name: Shiyuan Zheng
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: The most detailed book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2021
Review: The most detailed book on the subject. Easy to understand and you only need a little bit real analysis background before reading it. It also has many examples.

Title: Excellent for those interested in probability and statistics
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2017
Review: Excellent for those interested in probability and statistics. Even with more modern books out (i.e. Durrett), I still consult this one the most. Make sure to find the 3rd edition, and not the anniversary edition.

Title: Just as a heads-up, this is the version from ...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2015
Review: Just as a heads-up, this is the version from Wiley India, so it comes on recycled paper and does not look quite as fancy as you might be used to from US versions of math books.

Title: Disappointed.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2017
Review: This book is a disaster to learn from. It is an extremely poorly organized book with no
logical structuring of the material. I do not believe that this is a good book to learn
probability and measure theory from. If you are not already familiar with most of the concepts
then I recommend starting your journey elsewhere.

Title: Solid and Elementary
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2008
Review: This book was my first introduction into probability so I am somewhat sentimentally attached to it. The exposition is very, very careful and there is very little a reader has to do than to read carefully meaning that this text is a solid introduction to a serious probability for upper class undergraduates or beginning graduate students.
As a graduate student I very much appreciated the rigor and detailed approach in this textbook. Some of the topics like independence and martingales are developed with a rigor and details usually missing from undergraduate textbooks. If you do not like books missing any deductions this is your textbook.

But there are problems with the text, the major one being the outline and order of the exposition, sometimes it looks as if it was done at random though even that has been done with intention to facilitate understanding but has somehow gone a bit astray. For example it takes hundreds of pages to get into fairly elementary notions and then they are treated counterintuitive leaving reader without intuitive understanding of the topics. See for example exposition of expectation (general case) that is way too slow after hundreds of pages. Or discrete Markov Chains treatment early enough but completely technical and counterintuitive without ever leading a student to any concrete ideas. The integration topics are sprinkled all over the place as well.

Still I would think this is the text for introductory study of probability only with a instructor furnishing better choice and order of topics than the one presented in the textbook. It surely is one of the most detailed approaches geared toward a serious study. On the level of sofistication it does not come anywhere close to Kallenberg's "Foundations of Modern Probability" or Borovkov's "Probability Theory" but it does provide a treatise with important examples, without omissions (sometimes on the expense of elegance but every time for the benefit of reader), and with a rigor required while still being accessible to a beginning graduate student and thus it provides the important benefits of learning.

This is one of the plausible choices for two semester course in introductory graduate probability with perhaps Kai Lai Chung's classic Stanford textbook as the alternative.
